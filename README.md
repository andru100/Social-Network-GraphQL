# Social-Network

A combination of React based frontend and a Go based GraphQL backend.

Before running change the .env files args to your hosts ip address/dns name

Then run the container images *docker compose up*

This builds both apps with the backend GraphQL server running on port 8080. And a seperate file upload service running on port 8081. 

The frontend is served on port 80 and is accessible by typing your hosts ip address in your web broswer.

For further details see each repos README files in there respective directories. *Frontend-React and Backend-GraphQL*
